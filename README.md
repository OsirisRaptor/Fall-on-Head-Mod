# Fall-on-Head-Mod v0.1

The purpose of this mod is to generate 1 science point every time you drop a kerbal on its head.
How it performs in game is if the kerbal enters a ragdoll state you get a popup saying +1 Science. Your gains are reflected in science point count in the end of mission screen. This is a v0.1 version. I am in the process of making a better version.

The KSP Fall-on-Head-Mod is an experiment using 2025 era LLM coding assistants to create a KSP mod.
