# Fall-on-Head-Mod

The KSP Fall-on-Head-Mod was an experiment using ChatGPT to create script that would generate a science point everytime a Kerbal was dropped on its head.

I have thought of the idea a long time ago but lacked the coding expertise to create it.

The mod is fairly simple and was designed collaboratively, it generates a science point when a kerbal falls rapidly enough to ragdoll but not rapidly enough to be turned into a puff of smoke.

The results are so far encouraging and I think it is clear to all why this is an essential mod.

This mod is released under a do-whatever-you-want-license. Just leave credit if you use it in a video or something.
